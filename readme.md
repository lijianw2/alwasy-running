chains the execution of multiple commands

# how to use this tool? 
append the command you want to run in command.txt. One bash command per line. You can chain bash commands with "&&" or ";" etc. 

If you are using VScode with autosave on, try to append command as a whole directly rather than edit in the VScode window so as to prevent the script from reading in partial command


# how to rerun everything in command.txt? 
clear history.txt
